                     I’m a developer, guitarist, and photographer currently based in Barcelona.

                  <p>
                     As a developer, I specialize in backend development, primarily working with PHP and frameworks like Laravel.
                     I’m passionate about creating scalable and efficient solutions tailored to each project’s needs. I’m also the
                     co-founder of <a href="https://www.liquidbcn.com/" target="_blank">Liquid Studio</a>, where we focus on delivering
                     high-quality digital solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Outside of development, I’m a guitarist, playing both electric and acoustic. I’m currently part of the band
                     <em>Alice & The Wonders</em> and have had the privilege of collaborating with artists such as Chivo Chivato,
                     Dani Flaco, Daniel Higiénico, among others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     I’m also a photographer, focusing on portraits for local artists, capturing live concerts, as well as street
                     and travel photography. Through my photography, I strive to convey the energy and authenticity of each moment.
                     My creative pursuits are a vital part of who I am and influence everything I do.

                     All my development work is carried out through <a href="https://www.liquidbcn.com/" target="_blank">Liquid Studio</a>,
                     where we specialize in delivering high-quality digital solutions. From backend development with PHP and frameworks like

                  <p>
                     As a guitarist, I collaborate with artists and bands for live performances, studio recordings, and other musical projects.
                     I am currently part of the band <em>Alice & The Wonders</em> and have had the privilege of working with talented artists,
                     always striving to bring creativity and energy to every project.

                  <p>
                     In photography, I focus on capturing portraits, live events, street scenes, and travel stories. Whether documenting
                     the energy of a concert or the spontaneity of street photography, my goal is to create images that connect and inspire.
                     My photography services are available for both individual projects and commercial collaborations.
